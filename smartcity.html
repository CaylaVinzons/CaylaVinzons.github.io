        <span class="center subtitle">Ongoing</span>
        <p>As a part of Georgia Tech’s Eco Urban Lab, I am currently working in a studio designing the 2020 Olympic site in Misono, Tokyo. The studio is divided into four teams: Performance Modeling, Conceptual Design, Smart City Computing, and Community Engagement. I am a member of the Smart City Computing Team.</p>

        <p>Tasked with developing a plan of Internet of Things Integration for Misono, our team created three main subgroups: mobility, home, and public spaces. We developed a set of several individual product pitches for the smart city, with two more fully developed ideas.</p>

        <p>The first focused on <b>mobility</b>. We iterated on a graduate student’s project which involved the gamification of fitness apps. The system we created allowed users to prioritize transportation to their comfort preferences. It uses information such as the user’s available mode(s) of transportation, time allotted, or monetary priority to construct the most efficient and comfortable path from point A to B. It utilized the multipurpose streets created by Urban designers in efforts to balance the streets of Misono, particularly during busy times of the day: the morning/evening commute, and the beginning/end of olympic events.</p>

        <p>The second idea brought <i>interaction</i> to <b>public spaces</b>. We created a series of <b>time sensitive games</b>, at (1) minute, (5) minute, and (10) minute lengths, to display at transportation stations throughout the city. A Kinect would sense the activity of users who approached a screen, and activate simple instructions. Then users would be engaged in an experience that reflected one of three themes: Health/Olympics, Japanese Gaming Culture, or Japanese Culture.</p>
